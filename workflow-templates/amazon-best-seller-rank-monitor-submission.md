# Monitor Amazon Best Seller Rankings and Brand Share with Pangolinfo

Retrieve current Amazon Best Sellers for several category keywords, measure target-brand and target-ASIN presence, record the best observed rank, and alert when category visibility drops.

## Who is this for?

Amazon sellers, ecommerce operators, product researchers, SEO/GEO teams, analysts, and automation developers who need current structured data and an actionable report rather than a raw API response.

## What this workflow does

1. Monitor several Best Sellers categories in one run
2. Measure target-brand share of the returned shelf
3. Track the best rank for owned ASINs
4. Detect missing products and category visibility loss

## Setup

1. Use self-hosted n8n with community nodes enabled.
2. Install `n8n-nodes-pangolinfo`.
3. Create a Pangolinfo API credential and select it on the Pangolinfo node.
4. Edit only **Monitoring Configuration**, then run the manual trigger.
5. Connect SMTP or replace the email node with your preferred alert destination.
6. Activate the schedule only after a successful test.
